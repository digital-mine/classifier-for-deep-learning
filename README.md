# Classifier For Deep Learning

Here you can find 3 Python scripts I'm using to create a classifier for DEEP MACHINE LEARNING and A.I. purposes.

The scripts are coded to extract tweets from TWITTER, and create a raw database, than clean the the DB from similar entries, and finally allow you to label the extracted entries, and save the labeled classifier to a new DB.

In this example I'm using tweets because I think they are funny, but these scripts can be used with all kind of data.
